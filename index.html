                    <p>The wedding will be held at the medieval castle <i>Slot Loevestein</i> located at the intersection of the rivers Waal and Maas. Built between 1357 and 1368 on orders of the knight Dirk Loef van Horne, the castle has a rich history and served as an important strategic fortification from the time it was built until World War II.</p>

                    <p>As was the case with many Dutch fortifications, Loevestein made use of its natural surroundings (particularly the water) for its defenses and was a key part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollandic_Water_Line" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollandic Water Line</a>, a series of water based defenses and fortifications aimed to keep the province of Holland safe from land based attacks.</p>

                    <p>From 1619 the castle was used as a state prison for political prisoners. Notable amongst its prisoners was Hugo de Groot (Hugo Grotius), a Dutch jurist and writter, who laid the foundations for international law based on natural law.</p>

                    <p>Today Loevestein is open to the public, with the castle and surrounding fortifications preserved in excellent condition. You can learn more about Loevestein on <a href="https://www.slotloevestein.nl/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.slotloevestein.nl</a>.</p>
